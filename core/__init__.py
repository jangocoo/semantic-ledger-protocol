"""
Semantic Ledger Protocol - Core Prototype Package (v0)

This package provides a minimal, single-node reference implementation of:
- Embedding pipeline (pluggable backend interface)
- k-NN distance / neighborhood computation
- Novelty scoring function N
- Lineage construction and state transitions

It is not a production implementation and omits networking, consensus,
and economic logic.
